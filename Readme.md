# SuperLearner Ensemble Classifier

(https://github.com/Milind-Satpute/Super-Learner-Ensemble)

The Super Learner is a heterogeneous stacked ensemble classifier. 
This is a classification model that uses a set of base classifiers of different types 
(namely LogisticRegression, KNN Classifier, RandomForestClassifier, AdaBoostClassifier, GaussianNBLogisticRegression, KNN Classifier, RandomForestClassifier, AdaBoostClassifier, GaussianNB), 
the outputs of which are then combined in another classifier at the stacked layer(LogisticRegression).
Ablity to  provide accuracy 98% based on type of data.
